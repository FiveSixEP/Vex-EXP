Welcome to the GitHub repository for the VEX EXP robots! This repository contains all the code you need to program and control your VEX EXP robot using the VEXcode software.

## What is VEX EXP?

VEX EXP (Education Platform) is a platform for students to design, build, and program robots using the VEX EXP kit. The kit includes various components such as motors, sensors, and a microcontroller that allows the robot to be controlled using code.

## Getting Started

To use the code in this repository, you will need to have the VEXcode software installed on your computer. You can download the software from the VEX Robotics website [here](https://www.vexrobotics.com/vexcode-download).

Once you have the software installed, you can copy the code from this repository to your local machine and open it in VEXcode.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into folders based on the functionality of the robot. The main folders are:

- `Autonomous`: Contains code for programming the robot to perform specific tasks autonomously.

- `TeleOp`: Contains code for controlling the robot using a joystick or controller.

Each folder contains subfolders with code examples and projects. You can explore each folder to see the available code and projects.
